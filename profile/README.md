## 🚀 **Our Repositories**

1. **[Cuby Solve API](https://github.com/Cuby-Project/Cuby-solve-API)**  
   A Python Flask service that provides a solving algorithm for Rubik's Cube. It uses the Cosiemba algorithm to offer fast and accurate solutions.  
   🔧 *Technologies:* Python, Flask

2. **[Cuby Capture Website](https://github.com/Cuby-Project/Cuby-capture-website)**  
   A React application dedicated to capturing Rubik's Cube configurations through the user module. It allows analyzing and sending cube images to the API for solving.  
   💻 *Technologies:* ReactJS

3. **[Cuby Capture API](https://github.com/Cuby-Project/Cuby-capture-API)**  
   An ASP.NET API that handles the capture and communication between the capture website and the Electron client. This API bridges the front-end and solving features.  
   🛠️ *Technologies:* ASP.NET, C#

4. **[Cuby Client](https://github.com/Cuby-Project/Cuby-Client)**  
   The Electron application that centralizes features for the end-user. Manage your cube solutions, statistics, and more, all from your desktop!  
   📦 *Technologies:* ElectronJS
